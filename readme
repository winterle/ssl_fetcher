SSL certificate fetcher

Reads a list of ip adresses and connects via port 443,
fetches the certificates and saves them to .bin files
in 'der' format.
All the files have to be present when executing.
name_ip_list.txt --> list of ip adresses
workerx.bin --> target files where x is the number of the thread (currently [1-2])
The fetched certificates are seperated by the string 'XXXXXXXXXX'
and can be converted with openssl to a readable format.
